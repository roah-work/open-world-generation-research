# Open World Generation – Research & Resources

This repository is a curated collection of resources, references, tools, datasets, papers, and guides related to open-world design and procedural generation. It focuses on real-world urban logic, environment generation, infrastructure systems, and design methodologies used in creating large-scale believable virtual worlds.

This is mostly a repository for personal reference and research. Will be updated as I explore, study and research open world generation.
